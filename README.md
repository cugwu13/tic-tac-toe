# tic-tac-toe

User will be able to select 'x' or 'o' pieces to play rounds of Tic-Tac-Toe with a local opponent. When 3-in-a-row has been achieved, the board's functionality is disabled and the winner is displayed above the board. Players have the option to play again by clicking the 'Play Again' button.

## TODO:
- add UI (user select piece on page and not via prompt box, style the board)
